# Shopping List Organizer

> **Vibe Codedâ„¢** - This project was coded entirely by an AI assistant with human guidance, embodying a relaxed approach to development that focuses on getting things done while maintaining quality code. The implementation follows MoSCoW prioritization and a phased delivery plan, with an emphasis on practical, user-focused features.

- Syncs with voice assistants through Home Assistant integrations
- LLM processing for list deduplication and store section categorization
